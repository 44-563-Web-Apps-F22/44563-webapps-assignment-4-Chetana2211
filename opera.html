<h5>Exterior of Castle Bunthorne</h5>
<h5>
<b>SCENE-</b>
Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
on her left.  
Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.</h5>

MAIDENS:    Twenty love-sick maidens we,
                 Love-sick all against our will.
            Twenty years hence we shall be
                 Twenty love-sick maidens still!
            Twenty love-sick maidens we,
                 And we die for love of thee!
            Twenty love-sick maidens we,
                 Love-sick all against our will.
            Twenty years hence we shall be
                 Twenty love-sick maidens still!

ANGELA:     Love feeds on hope, they say, or love will die;

MAIDENS:        Ah, miserie!

ANGELA:    Yet my love lives, although no hope have I!

MAIDENS:        Ah, miserie!

ANGELA:    Alas, poor heart, go hide thyself away,
            To weeping concords tune thy roundelay!
            Ah, miserie!

MAIDENS:   All our love is all for one,
                 Yet that love he heedeth not,
            He is coy and cares for none,
                 Sad and sorry is our lot!
                          Ah, miserie!

ELLA:      Go, breaking heart,
                 Go, dream of love requited!
            Go, foolish heart,
                 Go, dream of lovers plighted;
            Go, madcap heart,
                 Go, dream of never waking;
            And in thy dream
                 Forget that thou art breaking!
